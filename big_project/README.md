## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Understand Requirements
Read `PROJECT_PLAN.md` thoroughly to understand:
- Phase 1 objectives
- Deliverable requirements
- Categories to avoid
- Evaluation criteria

### Step 2: Review Reference Document
Open and study the provided `ΑΑΥ επιλογή ιδέας εφαρμογής.html` to understand:
- Axis 1 requirements
- Axis 2 requirements (excluding input subsystem)
- Axis 3 requirements (excluding data)

### Step 3: Brainstorm Ideas
Use `BRAINSTORMING.md` to:
- Generate multiple app concepts
- Evaluate ideas against criteria
- Select your final concept
- Document your reasoning

### Step 4: Define Your App
Fill out `PHASE1_DELIVERABLE_TEMPLATE.md` with:
- App identity (title, category, description)
- Functional requirements mapped to axes
- User scenarios

### Step 5: Create Wireframes
Create wireframes for main screens:
- Use paper, Figma, Pencil, or any tool you prefer
- Focus on layout and interaction, not aesthetics
- Save images in `wireframes/` directory
- Add to deliverable document

### Step 6: Finalize Submission
- Export your filled template to PDF or DOCX
- Save in `final_deliverable/` directory
- Review all requirements are met
- Submit via Helios platform

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Keep it simple** - Focus on doing a few things well
2. **Avoid saturated categories** - No fitness, nutrition, heavy booking/shopping
3. **Leverage mobile capabilities** - GPS, camera, sensors, gestures
4. **Think interaction-first** - How is the UX better/different?
5. **Minimal backend** - Focus on front-end interaction design
6. **Low-fidelity only** - Don't create full Figma prototype yet
7. **No grade impact** - This phase is for feedback only
8. **Can change ideas** - But won't get feedback on new idea
