## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Will Cause Failure:
1. **Draft file instead of Team Project** → Graders need edit access
2. **No Team Library published** → Requirements explicitly state this
3. **Fewer than 9 design pattern annotations** → Requirements say annotate 3 screens
4. **Non-circular flows** → Requirements say flows must return to start
5. **Wrong device frames** → Must be iPhone 14 Pro (393 × 852)
6. **Only 1 link submitted** → Must submit TWO links (view + edit)
7. **Components not from library** → Final UI must use published components

### ⚠️ Will Lower Grade:
1. Lorem ipsum text → Use real content
2. Inconsistent spacing → Use 8px grid
3. Poor typography hierarchy → Use defined text styles
4. Missing component descriptions → Looks unprofessional
5. No Smart Animate → Prototype feels choppy
6. Broken prototype flows → Incomplete user experience
7. About page missing citations → Academic integrity concerns
