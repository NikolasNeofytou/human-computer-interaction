# Human-Computer Interaction - Semester Project
## Phase 1: Idea Proposal & Prototype

**Deadline:** October 21, 2025 (EXPIRED - but continuing for learning)  
**Current Date:** November 16, 2025

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **non-graded consultative phase** to receive feedback before the main implementation. The goal is to present your idea using **low-fidelity prototyping methods** for quick implementation.

### Key Constraints
- **Focus on front-end** development with minimal backend requirements
- **Simple but well-executed** - do specific things better than existing apps
- Use mobile device capabilities and advanced interaction techniques
- **Avoid saturated categories:**
  - ❌ Fitness and medical
  - ❌ Nutrition
  - ❌ Shopping (to a lesser degree)
  - ❌ Booking (restaurants, concerts, travel, lessons)
  - ❌ Wallet/budget

## 📦 Deliverables

### A. Written Deliverables

#### 1. **App Identity for Google Play**
- [ ] App title
- [ ] Short title (if applicable)
- [ ] Google Play category
- [ ] Promo/punchline (one line)
- [ ] Description (max 400 characters, one paragraph)
  - Address end users
  - See Google Play examples for reference

#### 2. **Functional Requirements**
Must include features from three axes:

- **Axis 1:** At least 1 functionality
- **Axis 2:** At least 2 functionalities (excluding input subsystem)
- **Axis 3:** At least 1 functionality (excluding data)

⚠️ **Note:** Reference the "ΑΑΥ επιλογή ιδέας εφαρμογής" document for axis details.

### B. Prototype (Wireframes)

- [ ] Design wireframes for main screens
- [ ] Skip trivial screens (register, login)
- [ ] Can be done via:
  - Hand-drawn (paper prototyping)
  - Templates (e.g., Sneakpeekit)
  - Figma with wireframing kit
  - Other design software (Pencil, etc.)
- [ ] Add explanations for app functionality

⚠️ **Important:** Only wireframes needed - **DO NOT** create full Figma prototype yet (that's Phase 2).

## 🎯 Development Plan

### Step 1: Ideation (Brainstorming)
**Goal:** Find a unique, focused app concept

**Questions to answer:**
1. What problem does this solve?
2. Who is the target audience?
3. What makes it different from existing solutions?
4. What mobile capabilities can we leverage?
   - GPS/Location
   - Camera
   - Sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope)
   - Touch gestures
   - Voice input
   - AR capabilities
   - Notifications

**App Ideas to Consider:**
- Education/learning (specific niche)
- Productivity (specific workflow)
- Social connection (unique angle)
- Entertainment (interactive)
- Accessibility tools
- Local community services
- Creative tools
- Gaming with purpose

### Step 2: Define Functional Requirements
**Map features to axes:**

```
AXIS 1 - [Research needed from reference document]
└── Feature 1: [To be defined]

AXIS 2 - [Research needed from reference document]
├── Feature 1: [To be defined]
└── Feature 2: [To be defined]

AXIS 3 - [Research needed from reference document]
└── Feature 1: [To be defined]
```

### Step 3: Create Wireframes
**Screens to design:**
1. Main/Home screen
2. Primary interaction screen
3. Secondary features screens
4. Settings/Profile (if relevant)

**Wireframing tips:**
- Focus on layout and flow, not aesthetics
- Show navigation between screens
- Indicate interactive elements
- Label components clearly
- Show different states (empty, populated, error)

### Step 4: Documentation
**Document structure:**
```
1. Cover Page
   - Project title
   - Team members
   - Date

2. App Identity
   - Title & Category
   - Promo line
   - Description

3. Functional Requirements
   - List by axis
   - Explain each feature
   - User scenarios

4. Wireframes
   - One wireframe per page
   - Annotations and explanations
   - User flow diagram (optional but helpful)

5. Appendix (if needed)
   - Additional notes
   - References
```

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

### Wireframing Tools
- **Figma** (recommended, free): https://www.figma.com
- **Pencil Project** (open source): https://pencil.evolus.vn
- **Sneakpeekit** (paper templates): https://sneakpeekit.com
- **Balsamiq** (paid)

### Reference Apps
- Browse Google Play for inspiration
- Study app descriptions and categories
- Note what makes good UX

### Documentation
- Review "ΑΑΥ επιλογή ιδέας εφαρμογής.html" for axis definitions

---

## ✅ Next Actions

1. **Read reference document** to understand Axis 1, 2, 3 requirements
2. **Brainstorm app ideas** (2-3 concepts)
3. **Select final concept** based on feasibility and uniqueness
4. **Map features to axes**
5. **Create wireframes** (low-fidelity is fine)
6. **Write documentation**
7. **Review and refine**
8. **Submit deliverable**

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Keep it simple** - Better to do 3 things well than 10 things poorly
2. **Think mobile-first** - Leverage device capabilities
3. **Focus on interaction** - Novel gestures, smooth flows, intuitive design
4. **Get feedback early** - Show wireframes to potential users
5. **Be specific** - "A cooking app" is too broad, "A recipe app that uses AR to overlay instructions" is specific
6. **Document clearly** - Professors should understand your vision from the document alone

## 📝 Notes

- This phase is consultative (no grade impact)
- You can change ideas after Phase 1 feedback
- If you change ideas, you won't get feedback on the new one
- Phase 2 will involve full Figma prototype development
