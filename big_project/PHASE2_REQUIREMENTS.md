## What We Need to Do (TODAY)

### ✅ Already Complete:
- 7 wireframes created (Screen 1-7)
- Complete concept and features documented
- SVG assets created

### 🔨 To Do (Phase 2 - URGENT):

#### **Step 1: Create Figma Team Project** (30 min)
1. Create team in Figma (if not exists)
2. Create new team project: "GestureCards - HCI Phase 2"
3. Set up 5 pages: About, Wireframes, Our Assets, Final UI, Prototype

#### **Step 2: Migrate Wireframes to Team Project** (1 hour)
1. Copy existing 7 wireframe frames to "Wireframes" page
2. Add device frames (iPhone 14 Pro)
3. Annotate 3 key screens with design patterns:
   - **Screen 3 (Camera Gestures):** Recognition pattern, Progressive disclosure
   - **Screen 5 (Victory Photo):** Celebration pattern, Social sharing
   - **Screen 7 (Adaptive Dashboard):** Dashboard pattern, Data visualization

#### **Step 3: Create Atomic Design Assets** (3-4 hours)
**Atoms:**
- Colors (primary, secondary, background, text)
- Typography (heading, body, caption styles)
- Icons (gesture icons, UI icons)
- Basic shapes (cards, dividers)

**Molecules:**
- Button component (variants: primary, secondary, disabled)
- Card component (variants: player card, stat card)
- Input field
- Slider component (haptic intensity)

**Organisms:**
- Navigation bar (top bar with back/title/actions)
- Player hand component (5 cards layout)
- Camera viewfinder component
- Stats dashboard component

**Publish to Team Library**

#### **Step 4: Build Final UI** (4-5 hours)
- Recreate all 7 screens using components from library
- Add colors, icons, images
- Apply Material Design 3 styling
- Use component instances (not local copies)

#### **Step 5: Create Prototype** (2-3 hours)
- Copy Final UI to Prototype page
- Add flows and interactions:
  - **Flow 1:** Gesture tutorial → Gameplay
  - **Flow 2:** Gameplay → Camera ready-check → Deal cards → Back to gameplay
  - **Flow 3:** Gameplay → AR mode → Back
  - **Flow 4:** Win game → Victory photo → Share → Back to menu
  - **Flow 5:** Settings → Haptic customization → Save → Back
  - **Flow 6:** Adaptive dashboard → View stats → Back
- Add gestures:
  - **Swipe left/right** on cards (browse hand)
  - **Swipe up** (play card)
  - **Long press** (card details)
  - **Drag** (AR card placement)
- Ensure circular flows (all paths return to start)
- Set device: iPhone 14 Pro

#### **Step 6: Test & Submit** (30 min)
1. Publish Team Library
2. Get share link (design mode)
3. Get invite link (edit access)
4. Test in incognito tab
5. Submit to Helios before 11:59 PM Tuesday

## Time Budget (Total: 11-14 hours)

**If starting NOW (Nov 17, 6 PM):**
- **Today (Nov 17):** 6-8 hours work → Complete Steps 1-3
- **Tomorrow (Nov 18):** 5-6 hours work → Complete Steps 4-6, submit before deadline

**Critical Path:**
1. Team project setup (30 min) - DO FIRST
2. Wireframes migration + annotations (1 hour)
3. Atomic assets + library publish (4 hours) - PARALLEL WORK POSSIBLE
4. Final UI with components (4-5 hours)
5. Prototype with flows/gestures (2-3 hours)
6. Test and submit (30 min)

## Design Patterns for Annotation (3 Screens)

### Screen 3: Camera Gesture Interface
**Design Patterns Used:**
1. **Input Prompt** - Clear visual cue for hand gesture input
2. **Progress Indicator** - Shows 3/4 players ready
3. **Status Feedback** - "Wave detected!" immediate confirmation
4. **Multi-user Coordination** - Visual grid of all player states

### Screen 5: Victory Photo Capture
**Design Patterns Used:**
1. **Celebration Pattern** - Positive reinforcement with trophy/confetti
2. **Countdown Pattern** - "3...2...1" prepares user for photo
3. **Social Sharing** - One-tap share to social platforms
4. **Contextual Stats** - Game summary alongside photo

### Screen 7: Adaptive Dashboard
**Design Patterns Used:**
1. **Dashboard Pattern** - At-a-glance metrics overview
2. **Data Visualization** - Pie chart for gesture usage distribution
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - "View Full Stats" for detailed info
4. **Recommendation Engine** - AI suggestions based on behavior

## Material Design 3 Integration

### Import from Community:
1. Search Figma Community: "Material Design 3 Kit"
2. Use official Google kit: "Material 3 Design Kit"
3. Import to team project
4. Enable as Team Library

### Key MD3 Components to Use:
- **Buttons:** Filled, outlined, text variants
- **Cards:** Elevated, filled, outlined
- **Navigation:** Top app bar, bottom navigation
- **Typography:** Roboto font, type scale
- **Color:** Dynamic color tokens

## Priority Actions (RIGHT NOW)

### If you have 12+ hours before deadline:
✅ Follow full workflow above

### If you have 6-8 hours (LIKELY CASE):
1. **Simplify:** Focus on 5 core screens instead of 7
2. **Reuse:** Import Material Design 3 kit heavily
3. **Prioritize:** Complete Wireframes + Assets + Prototype (skip elaborate Final UI)
4. **Essential flows:** Tutorial → Gameplay → Camera gestures → Victory

### If you have < 6 hours (EMERGENCY):
1. **Minimal wireframes:** 5 screens, quick annotations
2. **Basic assets:** Import MD3, create only critical custom components
3. **Essential prototype:** 3 main flows with basic interactions
4. **Submit something functional:** Better partial than nothing

## Next Steps

**Immediate action items:**
1. Open Figma → Create team (if not exists)
2. Create team project: "GestureCards - HCI Phase 2"
3. Set up 5 pages
4. Start migrating wireframes

**Ready to start?** Say:
- **"Start Phase 2"** - I'll guide you step-by-step
- **"Quick version"** - Streamlined workflow for tight deadline
- **"Help with patterns"** - I'll explain design patterns for annotations

⏰ **Time is critical!** Let's begin immediately! 🚀
