## 🚨 CRITICAL PATH (Cannot Skip)

These steps MUST be done in order:
1. Step 1 (Setup) → Step 3 (Library) → Step 4 (Final UI) → Step 5 (Prototype)

These can be done anytime:
- Step 0 (About) - paste whenever
- Step 2 (Wireframes) - can be done after Step 4 if needed

**Why**: Final UI requires published library, Prototype requires Final UI screens.

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR SPEED

### Figma Shortcuts
- `F` = Frame tool (create iPhone frames fast)
- `R` = Rectangle
- `T` = Text
- `O` = Ellipse/Circle
- `L` = Line
- `Cmd/Ctrl + D` = Duplicate
- `Alt + Drag` = Duplicate while dragging
- `Shift + S` = Sticky note (annotations)
- `Alt + 2` = Assets panel (library)

### Time Savers
- **Import Material Design 3 kit** from Figma Community (saves 1-2 hours on atoms)
- **Use plugins**: Iconify (icons), Content Reel (fake data), Stark (contrast check)
- **Copy/paste between frames** instead of rebuilding (Cmd+C, Cmd+V)
- **Create 1 card, duplicate 6 times** for similar screens
- **Smart Animate everything** (saves manual animation notes)

### Quality Savers
- **8px grid** (View → Layout Grids) - auto-align everything
- **Color/Text styles first** - prevents inconsistency later
- **Component variants** - don't create separate components
- **Test prototype after every 2 flows** - catch breaks early

## 🎬 START NOW: Step 0 (About Page)

I'm generating the About page content next. This takes 15 minutes and you can paste it into Figma while working on other steps.

**What you'll get**:
- Phase 1 summary (app identity, features, gestures)
- Phase 2 process (wireframes → assets → UI → prototype)
- Design patterns used (9 patterns from Tidwell)
- Citations (Tidwell book, Material Design 3)
- Team information template
- Professional formatting for Figma
