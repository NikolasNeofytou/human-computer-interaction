# STEP 6: Test & Submit - Execution Checklist
## ⏱️ Time: 30-45 minutes | 📍 Final steps before submission

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Validate the Figma file, verify Team Library & prototype, grab the two required links (view + edit), test in incognito, and prepare the exact two-line submission for Helios.

---

## ✅ PRE-SUBMISSION CHECKS (15 minutes)
Work through this checklist in order. Mark each step complete in Figma as you go.

### 1) Library & Components
- [ ] Open **Assets** panel → Confirm **"GestureCards Design System"** (purple book) is visible
- [ ] Open a new duplicate of your design file (File → Duplicate) and verify components appear via Assets panel
- [ ] In the duplicate, drag a few components from the Assets panel onto a blank page to ensure library is accessible

### 2) Pages & Frames
- [ ] Confirm all 5 pages exist: `1. About`, `2. Wireframes`, `3. Our Assets`, `4. Final UI`, `5. Prototype`
- [ ] Confirm `4. Final UI` has all 7 high-fidelity frames
- [ ] Confirm `5. Prototype` has the starting frame set (Screen 1)
- [ ] Confirm `2. Wireframes` contains the annotated 3 screens (3, 5, 7)

### 3) Prototype Verification
- [ ] Enter Present mode (Play) and run through each main flow:
  - Tutorial → Gameplay
  - Gameplay → Camera → back
  - Gameplay → AR → back
  - Gameplay → Victory → Capture → Share → back
  - Gameplay → Settings → back
  - Gameplay → Dashboard → back
- [ ] Confirm overlays work and close correctly
- [ ] Confirm Smart Animate continuity on repeated elements (cards, nav bar)
- [ ] Confirm mobile layout (use Figma Mirror or preview on phone) and make adjustments for tap targets

### 4) Accessibility & Polish
- [ ] Contrast: run quick contrast check for primary text on backgrounds (tools: Stark plugin or manual checks)
- [ ] Text sizes >= 12px for body, tap targets >= 44px
- [ ] Add brief alt/aria note in About page for major images (how they'd be read aloud)
- [ ] Spellcheck all visible text

### 5) About Page Content
- [ ] Copy Phase 1 summary into `1. About` page (shortened, 400-600 words)
- [ ] Add team member names + roles + contact email
- [ ] Add citations: "Designing Interfaces" (Tidwell) and Material Design 3 kit

## 🔗 GET THE TWO REQUIRED LINKS (5 minutes)
You must submit two separate links to Helios: (A) View/Share link and (B) Invite/Edit link.

### A — Share Link (View access)
1. Click **Share** (top-right of Figma)
2. Under link settings, set **"Anyone with the link"** → **Can view**
3. Click **Copy link**
4. Paste into a safe place (e.g., Notepad) — this will be the first line of your Helios submission

### B — Invite Link (Edit access)
There are two methods depending on your team settings and admin privileges.

Method 1 (Preferred - Team Admin):
1. Click **Share**
2. Under "Invite to file" → click the dropdown near the email field
3. Change permission to **"Anyone with the link can edit"**
4. Click **Copy invite link**
5. Paste into Notepad — this will be the second line of your Helios submission

Method 2 (If the previous option is disabled):
1. In the team settings (left sidebar), invite a placeholder email (your second email or friend's) with edit access and copy the invitation link.
2. Alternatively, invite graders directly by email if required by Helios.

**Important**: Confirm the invite link grants edit access in an incognito/private browser session (see test below)

---

## 🔍 INCognito VERIFICATION (5 minutes)
Test both links in a private window to ensure they behave as expected.

1. Open a private/incognito browser window
2. Paste the **Share (view) link** → Confirm file opens in view-only mode
3. Paste the **Invite (edit) link** → Confirm it either:
   - Opens and allows editing, OR
   - Prompts to sign in then allows editing after login (acceptable if it requests account)
4. If Invite link fails to allow editing, regenerate it or use team admin settings to toggle link permissions

---

## ✉️ PREPARE HELIOS SUBMISSION (2 minutes)
Compose your Helios submission exactly as required (two lines):

Line 1: [Share link — set to "Anyone can view"]
Line 2: [Invite link — set to "Anyone can edit"]

Example (do not copy; replace with your links):
```
https://www.figma.com/file/xxxxxxxx/GestureCards-Complete?node-id=0%3A1
https://www.figma.com/file/xxxxxxxx/GestureCards-Complete?invite=xxxxxx
```

---

## 🧾 FINAL NOTES FOR GRADERS (add these in About page or as a separate document):
- Brief paragraph mapping features to course axes (Axis 1 - multi-sensor + haptics; Axis 2a - gesture vocabulary; Axis 2b - adaptive UI; Axis 3 - proximity multiplayer)
- Short list of interactions that are simulated in the prototype vs. implemented in-app (e.g., Pinch to resize: annotated; Shake to shuffle: simulated via button)
- Instructions for running prototype on a phone (Figma Mirror) and list of features that require device sensors to fully evaluate

---

## ✅ FINAL SUBMISSION CHECKLIST (1 minute)
- [ ] Share link (view) copied
- [ ] Invite link (edit) copied
- [ ] Incognito test passed
- [ ] About page includes Phase 1 summary + citations
- [ ] Prototype starting frame set and flows tested
- [ ] Team Library published and components testable in duplicate file

---

## ⏭️ AFTER SUBMISSION
- Save a local PDF export of the About page + thumbnails from `4. Final UI` (File → Export frames as PDF) as a backup
- Keep the Figma file open and monitor any grader comments (they may request edit access)

---

When ready, paste the two links here and I will do a final quick sanity check (open them in view-only mode) before you submit to Helios.
